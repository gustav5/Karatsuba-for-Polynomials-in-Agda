<b>A Formal Proof of Karatsuba's Algorithm in Agda</b>


In this repo, a proof that Karatsuba's Algorithm for polynomials is equal to an ordinary polynomial multiplication algorithm is presented. We are using list polynomials with integer coefficients. We have assumed a couple of things that there was not enough time to prove. These are the assuptions in the module surrounding the proof.

This work was my thesis for my bachelors degree in Computer Science at Stockholm University. The whole thesis is included as "2022_thesis.pdf" in the repo.
