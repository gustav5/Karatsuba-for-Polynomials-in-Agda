In this repo, a proof that Karatsuba's Algorithm for polynomials is equal to an ordinary polynomial multiplication algorithm is presented. We are using list polynomials with integer coefficients. We have assumed a couple of things that there was not enough time to prove. These are the assuptions in the module surronding the proof.
